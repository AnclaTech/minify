# Contributing Content

Thank you for considering contributing to Minify. You are welcome to contribute code to Minify in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1. You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. For company contributors special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.

2. There are **several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards** which need to be met (we also have to follow them). The respective section below gives more details on the coding guidelines.

3. **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted.** Some features may e.g. just fit a third-party add-on better. The code must fit the overall direction of Minify and really improve it. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution fits: the best way would be to just open an issue to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear you intend to contribute).

# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else), you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to Minify itself. In particular you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement, which can be [found here](https://cla-assistant.io/AnclaTech/minify). (This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company). If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the Minify CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. The CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

# Company Contributors
If employees of a company contribute code, in **addition** to the individual agreement above, there needs to be one company agreement submitted. This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](/CCLA.pdf) form. Then, Scan it and e-mail it to [olamigokayphils@gmail.com](olamigokayphils@gmail.com).

# Pull requests
Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the master branch will carry the title of the pull request.

The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged. Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.

**Pull requests that do not pass automated checks may not be reviewed.**
